# (Annoying) To-Do List
This is a repository for a to-do list application built for Android with Android Studio.

## Overview
This is a simple to-do list with a special twist on how its reminder works â€” you have to complete a simple math equation to silence the alarm (which is just vibration for now), or else the alarm will never stop ringing, *indefinitely*.

## Requirements
- Any Android device (API 26/Oreo/8.0.0)
  - Emulators such as Bluestacks or Nox may also work, as long as they have API 26
- Android Studio (to edit)

## Running
To run the application, you can either just install the .apk or run the app directly through Android Studio.
